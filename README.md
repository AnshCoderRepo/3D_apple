# Apple 3D Product Showcase

A React-based 3D interactive showcase of Apple products, focusing on the MacBook Pro. This project leverages the power of **react-three-fiber** and **drei** to render a stunning 3D model with smooth scroll-based animations and environment lighting.

## Features

- Interactive 3D MacBook Pro model with scroll-driven animation
- Responsive fixed navbar with product and service links
- Realistic environment lighting using HDRI
- Built with modern React and Three.js ecosystem
- Styled with TailwindCSS for a sleek and responsive UI

## Technologies Used

- React 19
- Vite (build tool)
- TailwindCSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- Three.js (3D library)
- react-three-fiber (React renderer for Three.js)
- @react-three/drei (useful helpers for react-three-fiber)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnshCoderRepo/3D_apple.git
   cd 3D_apple/apple
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Usage
